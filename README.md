# Simple Analog Clock

The purpose of this project was to build a very simple clock. Using Vanilla JavaScript I could display a real world analog clock that it's predominatly fulfilling the function of telling the time. By utilising the `Date()`object and playing around with some of its functions such as: `getHours(), getMinutes, getSeconds()` the outcome was achieved.

## Set Up and Installation

If `SASS`is not present on your system, please run:

```
npm install -g sass

- To run the compiler, we need to have an existing`.scss` file and an existing `.css`file to then run:

```
sass --watch input.scss output.css
```
